# 🏭 Inventory Management System

## 🚀 Overview

The **Inventory Management System** is a cloud-native backend designed to manage products, warehouses, suppliers, and stock movements in a **secure, scalable, and production-ready** way.

This project focuses on **clean architecture**, **versioned database design**, and **enterprise-grade security** using Spring Boot and modern DevSecOps practices. It is actively under development, with core backend and security layers already implemented.

Repository: **Inventory-system-flyway**

## 🔐 Security Overview

The system uses **stateless JWT authentication** combined with **Spring Security**.

### Authentication Flow

1. User logs in via `/api/auth/login`
2. Server generates a signed JWT containing user roles
3. Client sends the token in the `Authorization` header
4. Requests are authorized based on roles and endpoint rules

### Roles

* **ADMIN**

  * Full access (users, inventory, admin endpoints)
* **STAFF**

  * Inventory-related access only

### Protected Routes Example

* `/api/admin/**` → `ADMIN`
* `/api/users/**` → `ADMIN`
* `/api/products/**`, `/api/inventory/**`, `/api/warehouses/**` → `ADMIN`, `STAFF`

Security is enforced using:

* `SecurityFilterChain`
* Custom `JwtAuthenticationFilter`
* `JwtUtils` for token generation & validation

---

## 📬 API Testing (Postman)

A complete Postman collection is provided for testing all endpoints.

* 📁 **Collection name**: `Inventory-API.postman_collection`
* 📌 Includes:

  * Authentication endpoints
  * Inventory CRUD operations
  * Role-based access testing

### Environment Variables

The Postman environment uses:

* `ADMIN_TOKEN`
* `STAFF_TOKEN`

These tokens are automatically reused across secured requests.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

* Java 17+
* Maven 3.x
* MySQL
* Git

### 📥 Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Inventory-system-flyway.git
cd Inventory-system-flyway
```

2. Configure database & JWT settings in `application.yml`

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/inventory_db
    username: root
    password: password

jwt:
  secret:
    key: your-secret-key
  expiration:
    time: 3600000
```

3. Run Flyway migrations and start the app

```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

4. Access Swagger UI

```
